## Recent Context (Last 3 Iterations)

<!-- This section is a rolling window - keep only the last 3 entries -->

### Initial State (v4)
- Game is functional single-file HTML (~900 lines)
- Has gender selection, customer flow, cleaning mechanics
- Basic sound effects via Web Audio API
- Needs: more polish, cartoony visuals, deeper gameplay, story

---

## Active Roadblocks

- Single-file constraint: all CSS/JS must stay in beaver.html
- No external assets: everything generated via CSS/SVG/Web Audio
- Must work offline in browser

---

## Project Learnings

Patterns, gotchas, and decisions that affect future work:

### Stack

- Pure HTML/CSS/JS - no frameworks, no build step
- Web Audio API for procedural sounds
- CSS animations for all motion
- Emojis for characters (considering SVG alternatives)

### Patterns

- `$('id')` helper for getElementById
- `game` object holds all state
- `CONFIG` object for tunable values
- Customer phases: enter → findStall → toStall → entering → inStall → exitStall → toSink → washing → exit

### Code Structure

- Lines 1-96: CSS styles
- Lines 97-164: HTML structure
- Lines 165-end: JavaScript game logic
- Key functions: update(), renderPeople(), updateStallDOM(), clickStall()

### Testing

- No automated tests - manual browser testing required
- Test checklist: title screen, gender select, gameplay, stalls, sinks, customers, sounds
