# Polish Loop

Add juice and polish to make the game feel amazing.

## Process

1. Play the game and identify ONE thing that feels flat or unresponsive

2. Add polish to that specific interaction:
   - Animation (squash/stretch, bounce, easing)
   - Sound effect enhancement
   - Particle effects
   - Screen effects (shake, flash)
   - Visual feedback (color, glow, scale)

3. Test in browser - does it feel better?

4. Update progress.md with:
   - What interaction was polished
   - What was added
   - How it feels now

5. Commit changes

**Focus areas:**
- Button/click feedback
- Task completion celebration
- Combo escalation
- Urgency/danger states
- Success moments
- Transitions between screens

If the game feels polished and responsive everywhere, output:
<promise>COMPLETE</promise>
